The R file included in this repository has all the code necessary to conduct the full analysis found in my thesis. The following data was used:

Lisiecki, L. E., & Raymo, M. E. (2005). Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of globally distributed benthic
stable oxygen isotope records [Dataset]. In A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally
distributed benthic d18O records. PANGEA. https://doi.org/10.1594/pangaea.704257

Petit, J.-R. (2005). Methane and carbon dioxide measured on the Vostok ice core [Dataset].
In Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core,
Antarctica. PANGEA. https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.55501

The files that are read by R are cleaned up versions of these datasets, with all the unnecessary text removed. None of the data itself has been altered in any way. I emplore you to download the data yourself and change the file name in the "read.table" command accordingly.
